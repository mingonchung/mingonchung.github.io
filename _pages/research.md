## Overview
The world is increasingly interconnected environmentally and socioeconomically through various flows such as the movement of goods, services, people, and capital. These flows have enormous impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem services, and sustainable development worldwide. However, little research has been systematically conducted on such flows across multiple coupled human and natural systems simultaneously. In this effort, I apply the frameworks of coupled human and natural systems and telecoupling (human-nature interactions between distant systems). My long-term research goal is to help reduce the negative impacts of ecosystem service flows on both people and the environment through the implementation of landscape planning and cross-border policies.
