<h2 style="text-align: center;">Teaching Philosophy</h2>
As an educator in conservation and sustainability science, my primary goal is to help students develop systems thinking and interdisciplinary problem-solving skills. I ensure students build both a strong foundation in ecological theory and the methodological rigor needed to analyze environmental data and translate scientific findings into actionable policy. My pedagogical approach integrates foundational concepts (coupled human and natural systems, ecosystem services, nature-based solutions) with advanced methodological training (remote sensing, causal inference, machine learning) through project-based learning. I scaffold semester-long projects where students identify environmental issues, synthesize diverse datasets, and propose management interventions, learning to navigate real-world tensions between competing land uses and stakeholder values. To lower barriers to advanced quantitative analyses, I employ open educational resources and computational tools, providing sample code and curated datasets that allow students to focus on scientific inference rather than syntax errors. Central to my teaching is fostering an inclusive and culturally responsive classroom through diagnostic assessments, diverse case studies reflecting multiple cultural relationships with the environment, and iterative feedback that helps students develop as independent researchers and practitioners.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Teaching Interests</h2>
My teaching interests span conservation science, sustainability science, coupled human and natural systems, ecosystem services, nature-based solutions, spatial ecology, and environmental data science. I am prepared to teach core conservation and sustainability courses, upper-level quantitative and geospatial analysis courses, and graduate seminars on interdisciplinary research methods.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Mentoring</h2>
Mentorship is a means of supporting students on their journey to becoming independent, successful researchers. In mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, I provide timely feedback and constructive comments while ensuring clear communication across diverse backgrounds. I support students in developing both conceptual understanding and practical analytical skills essential for success in conservation and sustainability science.
