## Welcome

I am a postdoctoral associate at the Environmental Data Science Innovation & Inclusion Lab (ESIIL) at the University of Colorado Boulder. I work in environmental and sustainability science, specializing in interdisciplinary systems modeling to address complex human-environment interactions. My research integrates the telecoupling framework with environmental data science to investigate the distant impacts of climate-related extremes on essential ecosystem services and how these impacts can be mitigated by nature-based solutions. My overall research aims to promote equitable and sustainable management strategies that enhance community resilience. My interdisciplinary approach integrates open-source datasets and data-driven methodologies to enhance science-based information for managing ecosystem services across multiple scales.

## Area of interest

Open data science; coupled human and natural systems; ecosystem services; sustainability; nature-based solutions; climate mitigation and adaptation
