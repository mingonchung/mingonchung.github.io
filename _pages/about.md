## Welcome

I am a postdoctoral associate at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado Boulder. As a conservation and sustainability scientist, I investigate how management actions in one location produce unintended cross-boundary spillovers that affect wildlife habitat connectivity, disease transmission, and human well-being. I integrate the telecoupling framework (socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances) with environmental data science to tackle coupled human-natural challenges. My research examines implementation gaps that limit the translation of nature-based solutions from ecosystem service potential to societal benefits under climate extremes. Using cross-sector data and advanced analytical methods, I provide science-based evidence that advances environmental and socioeconomic sustainability through equitable landscape planning and conservation policy.

## Area of interest

Coupled human and natural systems; conservation science; ecosystem services; nature-based solutions; climate adaptation; environmental data science
