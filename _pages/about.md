## Welcome

I am a postdoctoral associate at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado Boulder. As a sustainability scientist, I leverage environmental data science to investigate the complex dynamics of coupled human and natural systems. My research examines how anthropogenic environmental change alters ecosystem services and how nature-based solutions can mitigate these impacts. Using open, cross-sector data, I integrate advanced data science techniques into systems modeling. My research aims to promote equitable and sustainable management strategies for disadvantaged communities through informed landscape planning and cross-border management.

## Area of interest

Open data science; coupled human and natural systems; ecosystem services; sustainability; nature-based solutions; climate mitigation and adaptation
